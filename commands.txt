Add rule to block inbound TCP port 23:

New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block-Telnet-23-test" -Direction Inbound -Action Block -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 23


Verify rule added:

Get-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block-Telnet-23-test" | Format-List *


Test port (from same machine):

TcpTestSucceeded should be False if blocked.

If testing from another machine, run:

Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <WindowsIP> -Port 23


Remove the test rule when done:

Remove-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block-Telnet-23-test"
